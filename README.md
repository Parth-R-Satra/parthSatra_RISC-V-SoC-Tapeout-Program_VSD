# üñ•Ô∏è RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.  

"This program guides participants through the complete process of designing a System-on-Chip (SoC), from RTL development to GDSII, using open-source EDA tools. It is part of India‚Äôs largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, enabling over 3,500 contributors to create silicon and strengthen the country‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem."
