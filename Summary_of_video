summary of video -1 of the tapeout program 

The RISC-V chip tapeout flow starts with chip modeling, where two reference points are created: O0 (GCC model) and O1 (C-based specs). 
The GCC model ensures software compilation and toolchain correctness, while the C model defines the hardware specifications with a C-language testbench for functional validation.
With these golden references in place, the RTL architect develops the hardware description in Verilog (O2), modeling the processor, peripherals, and IPs.
This RTL is then synthesized into a gate-level netlist, alongside macros and analog IPs, which are integrated at the SoC level (O3). 
Once integration is complete, the design enters the physical design phase (RTL2GDS), involving floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing. 
The final design undergoes DRC and LVS checks before generating the GDSII file, which is sent for fabrication, completing the chip tapeout process.
